# SORAL

SORAL is the SAR_Bayes_ Optimal Resource Allocation Library, a programmer's API of optimization
 algorithms tailored to Search And Rescue (SAR). From an end-user's
 perspective, SORAL provides functions to best allocate a given
 set of SAR resources to most effectively find a lost person.
 The SORAL API is a simple, clean, modular collection of algorithms,
 each of which is optimal in its own domain. By virtue of plugging
 in to SORAL, each also provides important values for the end-user,
 such as probability of detection, coverage, and others.

 SORAL is free (<em>libre</em>) software available under the GNU
