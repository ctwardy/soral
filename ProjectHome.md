# SORAL: SARBayes Optimal Resource Allocation Library #

**SORAL** is a search theory library for Search & Rescue (SAR) programs. It does the hard math so your SAR program doesn't have to. The goal is to encapsulate all the search theory in a dedicated package which different applications could share. We provide a clean, modular, object-oriented API that handles resource allocation, and revises the probability map accordingly.

SORAL takes a probability (POA) map and some information about resource availabilities and effectiveness, and shows how to maximize the probability of success. It offers a variety of algorithms for different conditions. It also allows user-defined allocations, and computes the Coverage, POD, total POS, and the new probability map.

SORAL is part of the [SARBayes](http://sarbayes.org) project.

December 2010: SORAL hasn't been updated since ~2005, but I would _gladly_ accept any help to get it started again, and, for example, move the most recent code here.
