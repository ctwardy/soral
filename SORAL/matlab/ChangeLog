	* testcases.m: Put all test cases into testcases.m so we no longer
	load binary files. Much easier to see what the test cases
	are. I've left the old binary .mat files around for comparison. I
	had to make the comparisons approximate: round(temp*10000).

	* pivot.m: Condensed comments. Small bugfix and efficiency
	change. Tested OK.

	* pivot.m: Added a check at the beginning that
	sumMu(Rnew_subtreeRoot) < TOL. Added many comments about exit
	conditions relevant to TOL and tests thereby required. You know, I
	really should have used smaller release numbers.

	* chkMuSum.m (Rnew_subtreeSum): Fixed a cut-and-paste bug. Added
	some comments.

	* optimum.m (): Added check for 'Mu(i) > TOL'.
	Added check for 'Lambda(j) > TOL'
	Added a large comment block explaining why I added these things.

	* pivot.m (Solve for t_l): Added check for 'Lambda(Rnew) > TOL' when
	assigning t_l

Release 2.0	Now compatible with Octave. 
	dwa split the functions into separate .m files and replaced Matlab
	structs with normal arrays. Other minor changes.

	testcases.m added to load all the sample .mat files and test them.
	The .mat files are currently in Matlab v6 format and so cannot be
	read by Octave 2.0. Therefore Octave 2.1 must be used.

Release 1.0	First stable version
	Found to work with the example in Washburn's paper. Tested on
	other cases.
