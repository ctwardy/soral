SORAL = SARbayes Optimal Resource Allocation Library
18 Jan 2002

Currently the directory contains Matlab / Octave code implementing
Washburn's algorithm for multiple resources and a stationary target.
In particular, this version assumes all resources have an exponential
detection function.

From within Matlab or Octave, change to this directory and type "help
washburn.m" for instructions. Basically, if your area probabilities
are in p, your resource times are in T, and your effectiveness values
are in w, you type "washburn(p,T,w)".

   Files
=============

   washburn.m   --              The main function. Type "help washburn".
                                Most of the other .m files are subroutines
                                for washburn.m.

   testcases.m  --              Runs through all the test cases we have
                                defined and compares the answers with 
                                the correct answers. Now has test
								cases in the file as text.

   randsar.m    --              For stress testing. Generates random data
                                for p, T, and w. Useful for testing very
                                large problems.

   *.m          --              If not named above, it's a supporting
                                function for washburn.m.

   ChangeLog    --              Hopefully a current change log.
                                                


   *.mat        --              Test cases stored as Matlab v6 binaries.
								But Octave 2.0 cannot read v6
								binaries, and neither can humans. 
								Test cases are now in testcases.m by hand.
